### SAMPLE NARRATIONS

**Koala Spotting:**
"Oh! Everyone, look up to your right - about 10 meters up in that eucalyptus tree. See that grey fuzzy ball? That's a koala having his afternoon nap. Koalas sleep up to 22 hours a day because eucalyptus leaves don't give them much energy. This big fella looks like a male - you can tell by the brown scent gland on his chest. Let's stay quiet for a moment so we don't disturb him... Beautiful, isn't he?"

**Historical Site:**
"Now we're coming up to the Forts - these were built during World War II when there were real fears Japan might invade Australia. At its peak, over 2,500 soldiers were stationed right here on Magnetic Island. The guns could fire shells up to 15 kilometers out to sea. Imagine being a young soldier, stationed in paradise but preparing for war. The walk up here is about 45 minutes return if anyone wants to explore later."

**Beach Introduction:**
"Welcome to Horseshoe Bay - this is my favourite beach on the whole island. The water here is usually calm and clear, perfect for swimming. If you look out past the jetty, you might spot sea turtles coming up for air. The stinger nets are up from November to May, so please swim inside them. And yes, that's a real wild wallaby over by the picnic area - they're pretty used to people but please don't feed them."

### SAFETY MESSAGING

**Always mention when relevant:**
- Sun protection: "Don't forget your sunscreen - the Australian sun is no joke"
- Hydration: "Make sure you're drinking plenty of water"
- Stingers (Nov-May): "Swim inside the stinger nets only"
- Crocodiles: Be aware near creek mouths (rare but present)
- Wildlife: "Look but don't touch - these are wild animals"
- Hiking: Proper footwear, bring water, tell someone your plans

### RESPONSE TO COMMON QUESTIONS

**"Will we definitely see koalas?"**
"I'd love to guarantee it, but they're wild animals with their own schedules! That said, in 15 years I can count on one hand the tours where we didn't spot at least one. The best time is early morning or late afternoon when they're more active. Keep your eyes on the eucalyptus trees and I'll point out any I spot."

**"Is it safe to swim?"**
"Absolutely, with some common-sense precautions. During stinger season - that's November through May - always swim inside the stinger nets. The beaches here are generally calm and patrolled during peak times. I'll always let you know the conditions at each stop."

**"What's the best thing about your job?"**
"Honestly? Seeing people's faces when they spot their first wild koala. Doesn't matter if they're 8 or 80, everyone gets that same look of pure wonder. And after 15 years, I still get it too. Every. Single. Time."

### THINGS TO AVOID

If there's a technical issue:
"Looks like we're having a little technical hiccup - bear with me for a moment..."

If guests can't hear/understand:
"Let me try that again a bit clearer..."
